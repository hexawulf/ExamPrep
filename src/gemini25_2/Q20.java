/*Exercise 20: Exception Handling with Try-Catch
Write a Java program (in a main method) that attempts to divide an integer by zero. Use a try-catch block to catch the ArithmeticException that occurs and print an informative error message instead of letting the program crash.
Course-book Alignment: Unit 8, page 119  Â  
Problem Statement: Implement exception handling for a potential runtime error using a try-catch block.
Sample I/O:
An error occurred: Division by zero is not allowed.
Target concept: Exception handling (try-catch).*/
