/*Exercise 9: Relational Operators
Write a Java program (in a main method) that declares two integer variables, score1 with a value of 85 and score2 with a value of 90. Use relational operators (==, !=, <, <=, >, >=) to compare the two scores and print the boolean result of each comparison.
Course-book Alignment: Unit 4, page 60  Â  
Problem Statement: Compare two numbers using relational operators and print the outcomes.
Sample I/O:
score1 equals score2: false
score1 not equals score2: true
score1 is less than score2: true
score1 is less than or equal to score2: true
score1 is greater than score2: false
score1 is greater than or equal to score2: false
Target concept: Relational operators.*/
