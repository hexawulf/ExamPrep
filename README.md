Updated Prompt:
Task. Use only the material in “Course_Book.pdf” to write 20 beginner‑friendly Java coding exercises suitable for a first‑semester OOP exam.

Exercise design rules



One topic each. Every exercise must centre on a single Java construct or introductory OOP idea that the course book covers (e.g., fields, methods, for loops, if‑else, constructors, access modifiers, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism).

Course‑book alignment. Cite the chapter / section (or page) where the concept is introduced, so students can revisit the explanation.

Beginner level. Keep syntax and logic simple enough for someone who has finished only the first‑semester syllabus. Avoid compound features (e.g., no generics + inheritance in the same task).

Problem statement. Write a short, clear description of what the student must build or fix.

Sample I/O (when meaningful). If the exercise involves console input or produces output, include one small example.

Target concept blurb. End each exercise with a one‑sentence note that names the specific Java element being assessed (e.g., “Target concept: overriding toString()”).

No answers. Do not supply solutions or hints.
